# Sample Work: Test Plan and Final Report for New Sofia Software Release

## Overview

This is a sample work based on a test plan and final report assignment given by a recruiter for evaluating my skills in software testing, hardware integration, and documentation. The task involved testing a new release of Sofia software in combination with new hardware and firmware versions. The test plan was designed to ensure the solution works at a system level and can be used to create a deployment guide for a customer.
